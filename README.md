 In this repository is present the code I used for my MSc thesis titled: "Entangled dynamical systems on networks: a density matrix approach"
## This code serves to simulate two networks undergoing Kuramoto dynamics and subjected to the same external field. I take into account two different situations:
- Simple case: the dynamics of the two network is independent
- Complex case: the dynamics of the two networks is correlated: the interedependence is inserted in the external coupling that depends on the state of the two networks

Concerning the structure of the code, the folder "examples" contains the jupyter files to perform the main plots and some calculations:
- *biglyap* contains the calculation of the Lyapunov exponents for different parameter values
The folder "kuramoto" contains the python files to perform the majority of the calculations
