 This folder contains the code to perform the analysis of two networks performing Kuramoto dynamics and interacting with a common external field. Two different possibilities are considered: the first case is when the two networks evolve independently, we will call it 'simple' case. In the second possibility, instead, the evolution of the two networks is linked, we will call it 'complex' case.
 In the subfolder 'examples' are located all the jupyter files to reproduce the main results. Some examples are: calculation of the timeseries, calculation of the Lyapunov exponent to verify chaotic behavior and density matrix analysis.
 In the subfolder 'kuramoto' are located the python files needed to perform all the calculations required by the files in 'examples'. In particular, the ones with suffix 'com' are relative to the complex case.
